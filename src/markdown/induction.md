If $A$ is any set of natural numbers and
- $1$ is in $A$,
- $k + 1$ is in $A$ whenever $k$ is in $A$,
then $A$ is the set of all natural numbers.

We can use $A$ to represent the set of natural numbers that satisfy a certain property.

There is a more thorough form of induction:

If $A$ is any set of natural numbers and
- $1$ is in $A$,
- $k + 1$ is in $A$ if $1$, ..., $k$ are in $A$,
then $A$ is the set of all natural numbers.
