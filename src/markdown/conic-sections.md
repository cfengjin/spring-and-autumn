## Circle

A circle with center $(a, b)$ and radius $r > 0$ consists of all the points $(x, y)$ whose distance from $(a, b)$ is equal to $r$:

$$
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} = r
$$

or

$$
(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2.
$$

The first equation is an instance of the distance formula. 

## Ellipse

The ellipse is more general than the circle.
Instead of a single center, an ellipse has two foci.
It is defined as the set of points whose sum of distances from both foci is constant:

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

The major axis runs along the variable with the larger denominator, which denotes the length of the semi-major axis.

Likewise, the minor axis runs along the variable with the smaller denominator, which denotes the length of the semi-minor axis.

## Hyperbola

The hyperbola is defined analogously as the set of points whose difference of distances from both foci is constant:

$$
\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
$$
